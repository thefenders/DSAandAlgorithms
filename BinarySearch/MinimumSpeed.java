Enunciado:

You are given a floating-point number hour, representing the total time you have to travel.
You are also given an array dist of integers where dist[i] is the distance of the i-th train ride.
Each train must be taken in order and each except the last must depart at an integer hour (you may need to wait if you arrive early).
Return the minimum integer speed needed such that you can reach your destination within hour time. If it is impossible, return -1.
